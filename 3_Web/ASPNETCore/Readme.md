# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 24, ASP.NET Core

**ASP.NET Core** gives you the foundation of ASP.NET Core. Based on the dependency injection container you learned about in Part II, this chapter shows how ASP.NET Core makes use of middleware to add functionality to every HTTP request and define routes with ASP.NET Core endpoint routing.

This chapter contains these major samples:

* Simple Host (custom host )
* WebSampleApp (showing ASP.NET Core features including health checking)

Building this sample starts with an empty ASP.NET Core Web project, and adds many features of ASP.NET Core.

For deploying a docker image to Microsoft Azure, you need an Azure subscription and Docker Desktop. See chapter 1 for more information.

[See the commands to create an Azure App Service, Azure Container Registry, and push a docker image to the registry](createappservice.sh)
