# Professional C# and .NET - 2021 Edition

Code samples for the Wrox Press book **Professional C# and .NET - 2021 Edition**

To compile and run the samples, you need Visual Studio 2019, Visual Studio for Mac, or Visual Studio Code. 

You can download these tools here: [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/).

The console app samples can be used on Windows, Linux, or Mac. Here is the installation procedure for .NET: [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com)

If you're using Visual Studio, Version 16.9 or a later version of Visual Studio 2019 is needed. With the Visual Studio Installer you need to select this workload to compile most of the code samples: **.NET Core cross-platform development**. For working with .NET 6, you should use Visual Studio 2022.

ASP.NET Core samples need this workload: **ASP.NET and web development**.

See the [WinUI.md](WinUI.md) for the requirements of building and running the WinUI samples.

## Updates, .NET 6 and .NET 7 

* See [updates](Updates.md) for issues in the book and updates. 
* See [.NET 6 Updates](Dotnet6Updates.md) for changes with .NET 6 and C# 10.
* See [.NET 7 Updates](Dotnet7Updates.md) for changes with .NET 7 and C# 11.

The *main* branch is the actual working branch with code samples updated to .NET 7 and C# 11. Every code sample should compile and run successfully (with the deadlock and race-conditions samples, *successfully* means that a deadlock and a race-condition occurs).

The *dotnet5* branch is used to show the samples how they appear in the printed book.

The *dotnet6* branch is used to give you the .NET 6 (LTS) version.

## Issues and Discussions

If you find some problems with the source code, issues to compile and run the samples, please create an [issue](https://github.com/ProfessionalCSharp/ProfessionalCSharp2021/issues).
